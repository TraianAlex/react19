      "content": "React 19 introduces many exciting new features including the use() hook, useActionState, and improved Server Components support. The use() hook allows you to unwrap promises directly in your component, making async data fetching much cleaner.\n\nKey benefits:\n- Simpler code with less boilerplate\n- Better integration with Suspense\n- Automatic error handling with Error Boundaries\n- Parallel loading capabilities",

      "content": "When fetching multiple resources, parallel loading is much faster than sequential (waterfall) loading. With parallel loading, all requests start simultaneously, reducing total load time significantly.\n\nExample:\n- Parallel: 3 requests × 200ms = ~200ms total\n- Sequential: 200ms + 200ms + 200ms = 600ms total",
